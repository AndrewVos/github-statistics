  stupid bug, I bet this cost me over 8 hours of stupid shit in the last week. read_str2 was still using read_int32() to read strings.

  Essentially got terrain working. The geometry generation is still wrong and I need to add in a mode that updates in one fell swoop, rather than as we go (for loading and generation), but the basics are there.

  Workaround v8 bugs with small stacks
  
  v8 seems to have some issues when you try and use stack sizes smaller
  than it's used to.
  
  First is that if you attempt to set a stack limit that's smaller than
  the snapshot size (if enabled) it will crash your shit in a very hard to
  understand way. Unfortunately there's no way to actually know what that
  magic size is in advance, so I'm just using a secret v8 internal
  variable. This means that for most systems each coroutine will consume
  ~320kb of memory.
  
  Second issue is there's a bug on 64 bit platforms when your Javascript
  overflows the stack. It's probably pretty hard to hit this bug in
  regular code but it's still quite bad. There's a workaround that I'm
  using to get past that.

  Use the new git__joinpath to build paths in methods
  
  The `git__joinpath` function has been changed to use a statically
  allocated buffer; we assume the buffer to be 4096 bytes, because fuck
  you.
  
  The new method also supports an arbritrary number of paths to join,
  which may come in handy in the future.
  
  Some methods which were manually joining paths with `strcpy` now use the
  new function, namely those in `index.c` and `refs.c`.
  
  Based on Emeric Fermas' original patch, which was using the old
  `git__joinpath` because I'm stupid. Thanks!

  There is both success and failure here.
  
  My intent was to move some of the basic sinatra logic to rspec, mostly
  to demonstrate some of the cooler methods in the DSL, but then I
  noticed that the 500 posts test was dog slow in rspec, mostly because
  capybara does its remote testing in an actual browser.  This will be
  yet another thing to piss CI off.  There doesn't seem to be a way to
  specify :htmlunit as the browser for the selenium driver to use,
  though if you could you'd do it in that new code in spec_helper.rb.
  Another option would be to use selenium's :remote browser option,
  after starting up say the HtmlUnitDriver driver in another process.
  Or we could use the celerity driver, but that doesn't seem to work
  well with 0.4.0.  So we have a firefox window pop up during our rspec
  tests for now.

  Stream and Buffer based read/write loop.
  
  - We moved to sendfile before node.JS had binary buffers. A read write
    loop is a lot faster now than back when node was converting everything
    to UTF-8 strings. Sendfile isn't needed.
  
  Sendfile(2) was causing all sorts of hassles
  - Connections would timeout, then sendfile would try and send out a null
    file descriptor
  - Sendfile(2) has crap error messages for when the shit hits the fan.

Add stuff to give me syntax to generate methods with a custom metaclass, so that when I introspect - I don't have to use a fucking regex to work out what methods to exclude.

  r12048@t0mlaptop (orig r12013):  t0m | 2009-11-25 21:04:38 +0000
  Bigger than the current version
  r12049@t0mlaptop (orig r12014):  t0m | 2009-11-25 21:22:17 +0000
  Fix issues, more tests
  r12073@t0mlaptop (orig r12038):  t0m | 2009-11-26 22:58:09 +0000
  Remove dependency on parent.pm and remove from generated component classes
  r12074@t0mlaptop (orig r12039):  t0m | 2009-11-26 22:58:38 +0000
  Add a short todo list
  r12075@t0mlaptop (orig r12040):  t0m | 2009-11-26 23:06:57 +0000
  Update options
  r12076@t0mlaptop (orig r12041):  t0m | 2009-11-26 23:21:07 +0000
  These have gone
  r12077@t0mlaptop (orig r12042):  t0m | 2009-11-26 23:22:25 +0000
  Actually switch the create script to new script style. Testing I did yesterday obviously lies
  r12078@t0mlaptop (orig r12043):  t0m | 2009-11-26 23:25:07 +0000
  No, it needs to be left so that other components outside devel still work
  r12080@t0mlaptop (orig r12045):  t0m | 2009-11-26 23:42:06 +0000
  Remove the ability to generate short name apps. Refactor trivial stuff into attributes
  r12081@t0mlaptop (orig r12046):  t0m | 2009-11-26 23:42:31 +0000
  We already need namespace::clean directly, so depend on it
  r12082@t0mlaptop (orig r12047):  t0m | 2009-11-27 00:38:51 +0000
  More refactoring. Yes, there are too many attributes at the moment.
  r12083@t0mlaptop (orig r12048):  t0m | 2009-11-27 01:15:59 +0000
  Fix bugs
  r12084@t0mlaptop (orig r12049):  t0m | 2009-11-27 01:16:43 +0000
  Return true from the tests so that I can require them
  r12085@t0mlaptop (orig r12050):  t0m | 2009-11-27 01:17:35 +0000
  Properly fix the generated app test. Run tests in the generated app using the new subtest stuff in Test::More
  r12086@t0mlaptop (orig r12051):  t0m | 2009-11-27 01:18:47 +0000
  What was that for, die in fire
  r12087@t0mlaptop (orig r12052):  t0m | 2009-11-27 01:44:43 +0000
  Fix up all test tests
  r12088@t0mlaptop (orig r12053):  t0m | 2009-11-27 02:07:28 +0000
  More tests, bump required Cat version, update TODO
  r12090@t0mlaptop (orig r12055):  t0m | 2009-11-27 03:21:18 +0000
  Add more tests, kill off the required attributes and start instead building a data structure which is waaay more sane. Component generation now works again and has tests, except it fails for controllers - guess I probably knackered the template
  r12137@t0mlaptop (orig r12102):  t0m | 2009-12-01 02:29:08 +0000
  Rip out all the refactoring as it doesn't really go anywhere and things are still horrible. I think app generation can/should just be hit with a big stick instead. This breaks component generation, to be fixed
  r12139@t0mlaptop (orig r12104):  t0m | 2009-12-01 02:47:08 +0000
  Fix bug with generated component classes and an issue with the test
  r12140@t0mlaptop (orig r12105):  t0m | 2009-12-01 02:58:26 +0000
  All got tested
  r12141@t0mlaptop (orig r12106):  t0m | 2009-12-01 03:04:21 +0000
  TT helper still works just fine
  r12142@t0mlaptop (orig r12107):  t0m | 2009-12-01 03:06:55 +0000
  Less extra whitespace, use done_testing rather than have a test count
  r12143@t0mlaptop (orig r12108):  t0m | 2009-12-01 03:22:58 +0000
  Depend on default plugin versions which won't spit warnings everywhere
  r12144@t0mlaptop (orig r12109):  t0m | 2009-12-01 03:24:12 +0000

  r12145@t0mlaptop (orig r12110):  t0m | 2009-12-01 03:28:48 +0000

I have a feeling that all of this crap could be simplified, but I don't want to spend a lot of tuits changing it (and possibly breaking things for people with non-obvious behaviour changes like this one) - when those tuits could be spent on Plack stuff so that all this code dies anyway (and we do a major release so breakage can be more reasonable expected / extensively tested for).

  Moved a bunch of shit into a folder called other_shit. This is stuff I'm not using for Burning
  Man but have used in the past and might need later. (In fact the ambient files I'm probably moving
  back out of other_shit again.)
  
  Also created very simple ambient music file which does nothing except tour the circle of fifths.

  I'm committing all this strictly for historical purposes. This code sucks. It blew up
  on me in Toronto. Actually it didn't. But it could have. It represents serious hackery
  perpetrated in hopes of automating Ableton Live. It successfully automates Live but
  doesn't sound that great.
  
  The drums-only stuff is better. For Burning Man I'm going with drums only. And possibly
  adding new features tonight and/or tomorrow. So I'm stashing all this in git just in case,
  before I destroy it, because I need to throw it all away in order to get the Burning Man
  shit hooked up.
  
  To use this code, which you totally should not do, you need Ableton Live hooked up with
  tracks on 10 channels, and each fader level hooked to a controller on channel 0. I think
  I set it like controller 1, fader 1, through controller 10, fader 10, but I don't really
  remember. There's probably some other shit in here I broke for no good reason.
